This phrase might come in handy when you're traveling abroad notice that people do things differently than you're used to.","The squeaky wheel gets the grease.":"You can get better service if you complain about something. If you wait patiently, no one's going to help you.","When the going gets tough, the tough get going.":"Strong people don't give up when they come across challenges. They just work harder.","No man is an island.":"You can't live completely independently.
